# Evolutionary Algorithms

This project was started as an exercise to implement the [Evolutionary Algorithms][ea] (EA) learned
during an eponymous computer science lecture using the programming language [Scala][scala].

## Examples

Currently implemented example algorithms include:

-   [Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)][tsp]
